\section*{Work Experience}

\begin{description}
\item[Rapid Prototype Developer] Freelance \hfill July 8 - July 25 2024
\end{description}

\begin{itemize*}
\item Used a framework from the UE marketplace to build a deckbuilder prototype
      with unique gameplay mechanics
\item Researched and assessed how to use existing architecture with limited
      documentation, making use of its official support discord, as well as
      using engine tools like the reference viewer and blueprint debugger
\item Rapidly built UI based on mockup art and design specifications, using
      cutting edge engine features like the MVVM plugin
\end{itemize*}

\begin{description}
\item[Unreal Gameplay Engineer] Timberline Studio Inc.
    \hfill April 2022 - November 2023
\end{description}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Contributed to design and implementation of tech systems using Object
      Oriented solutions
\item Worked with designers to communicate needs for features by closely
      reading specifications and asking clarifying questions
\item Exercised skills in clear communication of goals, problems and research
      into potential solutions
\item Used design specifications to write interfaces from C++17 code into
      UE5 blueprint scripts
\item Rapidly prototyped and iterated on important UI features such as menus,
      notifications and item info, using the Common Game plugin from Unreal's
      Lyra project
\item Published in-depth documentation and tutorials on how to use custom tools
\item Regularly contributed to the software lifecycle by reviewing code, sending
      pull requests, and providing hot fixes for bugs

\item[SofaCollider HRTF Library] \url{https://github.com/josiest/SofaCollider}\\
    A library for reading HRTF files into SuperCollider
    
\end{description}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Rapidly prototyped a basic library for processing multi-directional HRTF audio data with SuperCollider
\item Formed creative solutions to interfacing between languages in order to
    use existing tools to accelerate project development
\item Wrote tools to read a write data to and from a standard HRTF format into
    the SuperCollider runtime environment
\end{itemize*}

%\item[ion library] \url{https://github.com/josiest/ion}\\
%    A small-scoped framework for rapidly prototyping games with SDL using C++20
%\end{description}
%\begin{itemize*}
%\item Designed and implemented interfaces from low-level resources such as
%      OpenGL shaders, into high-level resources
%\item Implemented a small event-handling interface to allow for flexible
%      video game system implementation
%\item Wrote a series of interesting example games used to createively showcase

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries tess}]
\item[tess] \url{https://github.com/josiest/tess}\\
    A library for working with hexagonal grids in C++
\end{description}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Implemented algorithms for working with unique mathematical norms in C++17
\item Wrote projections to and from pixel space and hex space using concepts of
      linear algebra and spatial geometry
\item Crafted carefully thought-out interfaces to make the library simple and
      intuitive to use
\item Used library tools to create a procedural hexagonal map generation tool
\end{itemize*}
